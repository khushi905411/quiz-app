# React Quiz App – Hybrid Assignment 03
Hi! My name is **Khushi** and this is my submission for **Hybrid Assignment 03** for the MTM6404 Web Applications course.

## 👩‍💻 About the Project
This is a fun and simple **quiz app** I built using **React** and the **Open Trivia Database API**.
When the page loads, it automatically fetches 5 random multiple-choice questions. The user can select their answers, submit the quiz, and then see which answers were correct. The app also shows the total score, and there’s a button to take another quiz by reloading new questions.
